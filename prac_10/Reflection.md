Throughout the duration of the course, 
I noticed a significant improvement in the accuracy of my initial estimates as 
I progressed and gained a better understanding of the concepts. 
I found that utilizing estimates is crucial when programming as 
they provide a target and help maintain discipline to complete tasks within 
specific timeframes. One aspect of the course that I particularly enjoyed was 
conducting code reviews for my peers. However, 
I noticed that I didn't receive many code reviews for my own practical assignments.
Although I received comments on two of my practicals stating that my programs were good, 
most of the time, I didn't have the opportunity to receive constructive feedback. 
Nevertheless, engaging in code reviews for others was a valuable experience for me. 
It not only allowed me to assist others in enhancing their code but also made me aware of the potential mistakes 
I could make in my own programming and helped me identify the aspects I had executed correctly.

What I would change: I would change the course to be teaching F2F instead of watching video.
